<p> As racism has grown and evolved, movements have formed with them. Surveillance has persisted in several Black-led movements throughout the years including the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950, the Black Panthers in the 1970s, and today,  the Black Lives Matter movement. After the emergence of Black Lives Matter in 2014, some have argued that police are surveilling participants from Black Lives Matter protests. There are a variety of ways in which law enforcement agencies are conducting this. These include: social media, facial recognition technology, drones, license plate readers, and many more. These various technologies have compromised several Black Lives Matter protesters by collecting their information, especially through social media. </p>

<h2> Various Tech Used by Police </h2>
    
<h3> Social Media </h3>
   
<img class="icons" src="images/socialmedia.png" alt="Magnifying Glass looks at messages">

<p> Police agencies can use social media to track protesters. <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/how-domestic-spying-tools-undermine-racial-justice-protests">Freedom House</a> discovered that these agencies used hashtags such as “#justiceforgeorge” and “#nojusticenopeace”. Through these hashtags, police agencies begin mapping out a person’s personal relationships in addition to locations.<a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/07/09/twitter-dataminr-police-spy-surveillance-black">The Intercept</a> also found third-party companies monitoring social media to tip the police off to protest locations, developments and alleged “looting” attempts. </p>

<h3>Facial Recognition Technology</h3>

<img class="icons"src="images/facerec.png" alt="Man getting scanned">

<p> Facial recognition technology uses software to identify an individual’s features and store the data as a faceprint. Through the faceprint, cameras can identify a person walking throughout the streets and connect them to their social media accounts, and other places they may have a photo. A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373316/nypd-facial-recognition-black-lives-matter">BuzzFeed</a> report from February found that the NYPD had run more than 11,000 facial recognition searches using technology from controversial firm Clearview AI, despite denying having any official contract with the company. The article also discussed NYPD using Black Lives Matter protesters' social media photos to identify and pursue them. </p>

<h3> Drones </h3>

<p> Drones are able to equip live-feed video cameras, infrared cameras, heat sensors, radars and more. The unmanned aerial systems wifi crackers and fake cell phone towers that can determine your location or intercept your texts and phone calls.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Atlas of Surveillance has found over 1077 law enforcement agencies utilize drone technology. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/george-floyd-protests-surveillance.html"> The New York Times</a> reported the Department of Homeland Security used drones to surveil Black Lives Matter protests across the country. The Department of Homeland Security claimed they deployed drones in order to protect the protesters and make-sure violence did not break out as a result. The New York Times article also cited the Department of Homeland Security did not say whether any law enforcement agencies had requested footage of the demonstrations. </p>

<h3> Automated License Plate Readers </h3>

<img class="icons"src=images/alpr.png alt="automated license plate reader">

<p> Automated License Plate Readers or ALPRs, are cameras that are equipped on police cars, lampposts, ontop traffic lights in order to track people’s license plates. Once a camera has captured the license plate, through a database they can identify who is driving that vehicle. Automated license plate readers are able to automatically capture all license plate numbers that come into their view of cameras, in addition with the location, date, and time the technology captured. The EFF’s Atlas of Surveillance has found approximately 766 automated license plate readers deployed in law enforcement agencies within the United States. <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/george-floyd-protests-surveillance-technology"> Buzzfeed News </a> reported in Minneapolis, where the protests first began after the murder of George Floyd, the police department has used automated license plate readers to potentially track the movement of people throughout the city. </p>

<h3> Conclusion </h3>

<p> As technology has persisted, more surveillance technology has been deployed ranging from facial recognition technology to drones. Today also presents the problems regarding social media and law enforcement agencies tracking individuals through their profiles on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and more. As time progresses, civil rights protesters will need to utilize tactics in order for their information to be safe. </p>
